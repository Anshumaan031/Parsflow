**AI Description (Gemini):** This stacked bar chart illustrates the proportional distribution of plot numbers (categorized as 1, 2, 3, and 4, represented by different colors) across nine distinct land use categories. Category 1 (blue) is predominant in institutional, commercial, and roadside areas, often exceeding 85% of plots. Conversely, Category 2 (red) is the largest proportion in community parks and woodlots, while Category 3 (green) forms a substantial part only in woodlots (~35%). Category 4 (purple) is negligible, appearing in very small amounts in municipal parks and riverside plots.

**AI Description (Gemini):** This image is a map titled "Florida Power Plant Location Map," depicting the state of Florida along with parts of neighboring Alabama and Georgia. It pinpoints numerous power plant locations throughout Florida, marked by numbered black dots. Major cities like Tallahassee, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa, and Miami are highlighted with purple dots, and a network of major roads is shown in red. Crucially, the map delineates five "Proposed Disposal Areas" (DA1-DA5) in light blue, located both offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic, and inland within the state. A legend, compass rose, and scale bar are provided for orientation and interpretation.
